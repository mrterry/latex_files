% Choose only one of the following document classes:
%
% for a 12 Point UW PhD Thesis without Margin Check
\documentclass[12pt]{withesis}
%
% for a 10 Point UW PhD Thesis with Margin Check
%\documentclass[10pt,margincheck]{withesis}
%
% The margincheck option flags lines which overflow their hbox with a black
%  box at the end of the line.  This usually (but not always) indicates a
%  margin violation on the right margin.  Left margin violations aren't
%  indicated and if the margin violation is large enough, there isn't room
%  for the black box to be visiable.  
%
% This option can be also used in conjunction with the msthesis option.
%
% or for a 12 Point UW Masters Thesis
%\documentclass[12pt,msthesis]{withesis}
%
% or for a 10 Point UW Masters Thesis
%\documentclass[10pt,msthesis]{withesis}
%
% The msthesis option changes the page margins from 1" all around
% (the PhD format) to 1.25" left and 1" remaining margins (MS format).
% The defaults for degree and thesis are changed to be MS and thesis.
% These defaults can be overridden if the margins for the MS thesis
% are desired for other documents.

% To include optional packages, use the \usepackage command.
%  The package epsfig is used to bring in the Encapsulated PostScript
%    figures into the document.
%  The package times is used to change the fonts to Times Roman; however
%    because the times typewriter font looks odd, the original LaTeX
%    Computer Modern font is kept for the typewriter font using
%      \renewcommand{\ttdefault}{cmtt}
%    Note that Times Roman is a PostScript font and therefore, the document
%    cannot be correctly viewed from the *.dvi file.  It should be converted
%    to a *.ps file first and then viewed with a PostScript previewer...
\usepackage{epsfig}
\usepackage{times}
\renewcommand{\ttdefault}{cmtt}

%========================================================================
%  Draft Control Commands:
%========================================================================
%
% \psdraft causes the \psfig or \epsfig commands to draw a box and label
% the box with the postscript file name instead of reading in the full
% postscript figure.  This can save time and toner when printing drafts.
%
%\psdraft
%
%
% \psfull causes the inclusion of the postscript figures.
%\psfull
%
%
%\pagestyle{thesisdraft} causes the footer text to become:
% DRAFT: Do Not Distribute        <time><Date>        <input file name>
%
%\pagestyle{thesisdraft}
%
%\pagestyle{thesis} causes the header and footers to be the correct format
%
\pagestyle{thesis}
%
%
%  The page margins can be marked with a post-script box using the
%  \draftmargins command.  This command uses dvips's end-of-page hook
%  This is only visible in the *.ps file (NOT the *.dvi file)!
%
%\draftmargins
%
%
%  The word ``DRAFT'' can be diagonally printed across the page using
%  the \draftscreen command.  This command uses dvip's beginning-of-page
%  hook.  This is only visible in the *.ps file (NOT the *.dvi file)!
%
%\draftscreen


%=======================================================================
% Remove the following lines if appendix tables or figures are present.
% The suppress writing the auxiliary information which appears in the
% list of tables or list of figures.
%
\noappendixtables                % Don't have appendix tables
\noappendixfigures               % Don't have appendix figures
